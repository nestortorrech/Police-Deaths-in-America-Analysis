The original dataset was collected by FiveThirtyEight and it contains police death data from 1791 to 2016.

The reason I made this dataset is because it had not been updated since 2016 and the scrapping script was outdated, so I decided to make a new scrapper and update the dataset till present.
I got this idea from the FiveThirtyEight group and a fellow kaggler, Satoshi Datamoto, who uploaded
the dataset on kaggle. Thank you for inspiration.
